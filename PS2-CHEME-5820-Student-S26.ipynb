After preprocessing the 299-patient dataset (binary recoding and z-score normalization), PCA visualization revealed the degree of class overlap in two dimensions, and both the perceptron and logistic regression were trained and evaluated on the same 80/20 split.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Preprocessing determines model input quality:** Recoding binary features to $\\{-1,1\\}$ and z-score scaling continuous features places all inputs on comparable scales for gradient-based learning.\n",
    "> * **PCA reveals class separability before training:** Projecting onto the top two eigenvectors provides a visual check of whether the classes are likely separable by a linear boundary.\n",
